# RhinoE4XDemo

Sample project showing the usage of Rhino and E4X working together to manipulate xml and run js code.
Just import it and your should be able to run the samples. 
Two types of samples there
* Rhino using inbuild Java support (Note that Java has stopped supporting E4X in its latest versions)
* Rhino using its own library (the jar located in the Lib).

# E4X is basically used to edit/read xml files.
